Letâ€™s create a list of user-defined objects. Because the ArrayList of objects is a must if we are going to complete our application. As objects are created for a class it is added in an ArrayList. This is very helpful when we want to access those objects. So now let's try out a simple list of objects in our application, using ItemType class. Get the attributes to create an object then add them n a list for future manipulation.

Strictly adhere to the object Oriented specifications given in the problem statement. All class names, attribute names and method names should be the same as specified in the problem statement.

Create a class named ItemType with the following private attributes

Attribute	Data Type
name	String
deposit	Double
costPerDay	Double

Included appropriate getters/setters, also include constructors.

Note: Override toString method to print details of the ItemType object as the specified format. Use %-20s%-20s%-20s" for the format.

Create a class Main and in the main method get the details of ItemTypes and store them in an ArrayList.

Input and Output format:
Use "%-20s%-20s%-20s" for formatting the output in tabular format.
Refer to sample Input and Output for formatting specifications.

Sample Input and Output :
[All Texts in bold corresponds to the input and rest are output]
