Given the list of Address details, sort them based on Pincode. If two address has the same Pincode, then sort them based on address line 1. Write a program to sort the users based on Pincode when certain details (City and state details) are unavailable.

Strictly adhere to the Object-Oriented specifications given in the problem statement. All class names, attribute names, and method names should be the same as specified in the problem statement.


Consider the class Address with the following private attributes

Attributes	Datatype
username	String
addressLine1	String
addressLine2	String
pinCode	Integer
Include appropriate getters and setters
Create default constructor and a parameterized constructor with arguments in order
Address(String username, String addressLine1, String addressLine2, Integer pinCode).

The Address class implements the comparable interface. Compare Pincode, If Pincode is the same then compare with addressLine1.

Consider the class Main to test the above class. Obtain input from the console and sort the user list based on pincode.
