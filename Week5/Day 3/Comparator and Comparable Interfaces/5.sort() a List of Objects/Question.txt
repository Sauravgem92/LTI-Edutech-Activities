Write a program to take hall objects as input in the list and sort them in the order of their costPerDay using the sort() method of the comparable interface. Then display them in tabular form.

Strictly adhere to the Object-Oriented specifications given in the problem statement. All class names, attribute names, and method names should be the same as specified in the problem statement.

Consider the class Hall with the following private attributes,

Attribute	Data type
name	String
contactNumber	String
costPerDay	Double
ownerName	String
 

Include appropriate getters and setters.
Prototype for the Parameterized Constructor, Hall (name,contactNumber,costPerDay,ownerName).

Override toString() and print the details in a tabular format. And implement the comparable interface in the class.

Consider the class Main and use the main method to get inputs, sort, and display.
