Write a Java program to collect integer numbers from the user and calculate sum of digits and display the unique sum in sorted (asc) order.

Create a main class "Main.java"
Create NumberSet class to store all the integers provided by user in a collection and calculate sum of digits.

Specification for NumberSet class

Scope	Method/Attribute	Type/Return Type	Name	Details
private	Attribute	Set<Integer>	numberSet	This set us used to hold the list of integers provided by the user
public	Method	void	insertElement
(Integer)	Insert the element into the numberSet
public	Method	SortedSet	getSumDigits()	Compute sum of digits for each number in the numberSet and returns the unique sum.
Use TreeSet to store the numbers in sorted order.

Input and Output Format:

 

First input corresponds to the number of integers (N) and followed by N number of integers.
Read the numbers in your main class and call insertElement() method to insert into the collection
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output]
Sample Input/Output :
Enter number of integers:
8
56
24
35
46
12
42
56
32
Unique digit sum
3
