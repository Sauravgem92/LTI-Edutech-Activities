Like List and Set, the other commonly used collection is Map. To understand it better, we shall go ahead and read customer information from a file.  (input.txt)
Map<String, Customer> customerMap = new HashMap<String,Customer>();
Map<Key,Value>
Key - email id
Value - customer object

Display the details sorted by customer email id.

Write a Java program to sort and display the call log. The call log contains details like Email id, Phone number, Start time, End Time.  The call log for a particular day is given in "input.txt" file.

Create a main class "Main.java". 
Create another class file "CallLog.java" with the 'email' and 'numberCalled' as String type, 'startTime' and 'endTime' as Date type. Include appropriate getters and setters.

 


Implement HashMap with customer email as key and list of call logs as its value.
