Read 2n numbers as input where the first number represents a key and second one a value. Both the numbers are of type integers. First number corresponds to student id and the second number corresponds to studentâ€™s marks.

Write a static method findPass  from UserMainCode to display the Ids of students who have scored above 75.

Create a Class Main which would be used to read 2n numbers and build the hashmap. Call the static method present in UserMainCode.

Input and Output Format:

Input consists of a 2n+ 1 integers. The first integer specifies the value of n (essentially the hashmap size). The next pair of n numbers denote the key and value.
