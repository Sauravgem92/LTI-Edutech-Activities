Read 2n numbers as input where the first number represents a key and the second one a value. Both the numbers are of type integers.

Write a function getSumOfEven to find out sum of all values whose keys are represented by even numbers. Include this function in class UserMainCode.

Create a Class Main which would be used to read 2n numbers and build the hashmap. Call the static method present in UserMainCode.

Input and Output Format:

Input consists of a 2n+ 1 integers. The first integer specifies the value of n (essentially the hashmap size). The next pair of n numbers denote the key and value.

Output consists of an integer representing the desired sum.

Refer sample output for formatting specifications.
