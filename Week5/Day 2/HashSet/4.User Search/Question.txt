In your application, it is time to experiment with a Set of user-defined Objects. Just like List of objects, Set of objects is also relatively simple.
Consider a Set of bank users. The set contains users who are inactive as well. The bank wants to retain only the Users who are active given a list of active users.

Strictly adhere to the Object-Oriented specifications given in the problem statement. All class names, attribute names and method names should be the same as specified in the problem statement.

Create a User class with the following private attributes

Attributes	Datatype
username	String
bankname	String
Include appropriate getters and setters.
Create default constructor and a parameterized constructor with arguments in order User(String username, String bankname).

Note:
Override equals method to compare the username
Override the Comparable interface to sort Users in Alphabetical order of Username.

In the Main class, Create a Set of user objects from the user input. Now obtain input in CSV format, create User objects and add to a List but with null values in bankName. Now Use retainAll() to remove elements in Set that are not in the present in the List.

Input and output format:
Refer to sample Input and Output for formatting specifications.
