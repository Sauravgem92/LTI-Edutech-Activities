Inheritance in Java is same as that of inheritance in real Life. A class which inherits another class obtains all the latter's attributes and methods. The former is called Child class whilst the latter is called Parent class. This phenomenon would be very promising in applications dealing with multiple classes that are constituted by similar or more likely same attributes. You 'll get to know the importance of inheritance from the following problem. All type of accounts in a bank have common attributes which can be inherited from an Account class.
