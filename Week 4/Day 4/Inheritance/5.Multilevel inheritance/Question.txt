Now we have gotten acquainted ourselves with multilevel inheritance, we can move on implementing in it our application. Let's consider the domain 'Stall' and its types. There exists a multilevel inheritance.

Create a class SilverStall with following protected attributes

 

Attributes	Datatype
name	String
detail	String
owner	String
cost	Integer
Create default constructor and a parameterized constructor with arguments in order SilverStall(String name, String detail, String owner, Integer cost).
Include appropriate getters and setters.
Total cost computes only the stall cost.

Create a class GoldStall which extends SilverStall with following private attributes

 

 

Attributes	Datatype
tvSet	Integer
Create default constructor and a parameterized constructor with arguments in order GoldStall(String name, String detail, String owner, Integer cost, Integer tvSet).
Include appropriate getters and setters.
Total cost computed by stall cost and TV set cost. Each TV set costs 100Rs.

Create a class PlatinumStall which extends GoldStall (i.e Multilevel Inheritance) with following private attributes

 

 

Attributes	Datatype
projector	Integer
Create default constructor and a parameterized constructor with arguments in order PlatinumStall(String name, String detail, String owner, Integer cost, Integer tvSet, Integer projector).
Include appropriate getters and setters.
Total cost computed by stall cost,TV set cost and projector cost where each TV set and projector costs 100Rs and 500Rs respectively.

Create a driver class named Main to test the above class.
