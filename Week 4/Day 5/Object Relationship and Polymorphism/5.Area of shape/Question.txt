Write a program to calculate the area of the circle and rectangle using the overriding concept in java.

Create a class Shape with the following protected attributes,

Attributes	Datatype
area	Double


Create the following method in the Shape class,

Method Name	Description
public void computeArea()	In this method assign area to 0.


Create a class Circle which extends Shape with the following private attributes,

Attributes	Datatype
radius	Double

Override the following method in the Circle class,

Method Name	Description
public void computeArea()	 Here Calculate the area of the circle and assign the value to the area attribute.
Area of the circle = (22/7) * (radius * radius)


Create a class Rectangle which extends Shape with the following private attributes,

Attributes	Datatype
length	Double
breadth	Double

Override the following method in the Rectangle class,

Method Name	Description
public void computeArea()	Here Calculate the area of the rectangle and assign the value to the area attribute.
Area of the rectangle = (length * breadth)


Create a class Triangle which extends Shape with the following private attributes,

Attributes	Datatype
base	Double
height	Double


Override the following method in the Triangle class,

Method Name	Description
public void computeArea()	Here Calculate the area of the triangle and assign the value to the area attribute.
Area of the triangle = (1/2) * (base * height)

Get the option for the shape to compute the area and get the attribute according to the shape option. Calculate the area and print the area.
While printing round off the area to 2 decimal formats.

Create a driver class Main to test the above classes.

[Note: Strictly adhere to the object-oriented specifications given as a part of the problem statement. Use the same class names, attribute names and method names]

Input Format
The first line of the input is an integer corresponds to the shape.
The next line of inputs are Double which corresponds to,
For Circle(Option 1) get the radius.
For Rectangle(Option 2) get the length and breadth.
For Triangle(Option 3) get the base and height.

Output Format
The output consists area of the shape.
Print the double value correct to two decimal places.
Print “Invalid choice”, if the option for the shape is chosen other than the given options.
Refer to sample output for formatting specifications.

[All text in bold corresponds to input and rest corresponds to output]
